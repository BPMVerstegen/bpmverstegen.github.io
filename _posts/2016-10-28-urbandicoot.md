Urbandicoot is a concept product and service that was developed in order to better explore cities from the metro transportation system.
Travelling by underground can often be the most efficient means of travelling for a plethora of reasons. As a consequence, we have to however give up the view of the scenery above the ground. The application brings users the above ground experience, as well as the option to explore along the stops of the subway system.

##Mobile Application
The mobile application is free to download. Using the app, travellers will discover many new sites, landmarks, cultural activities and food for instance, whilst even habitants using the app will find something new to do, as there are often temporary events along their routine commute.
