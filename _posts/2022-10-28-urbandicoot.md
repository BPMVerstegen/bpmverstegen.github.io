Urbandicoot is a concept product and service to explore cities from the metro transportation system.
Travelling by underground often is the most efficient means of travelling. With Urbandicoot, we no longer have to give up the view of the scenery above the ground. Urbandicoot immerses its users with the above ground experience and provides exploration along the stops of the subway system.

## Mobile Application
The mobile application is free to download. Using the app, travellers will discover the many new sites, landmarks, cultural activities and food.
Even your daily commute can become exciting again with the temporary events that are being hosted.
