## Accepting stress
Instead of fighting stress, we should embrace it as a tool for growth while also recognizing the importance of completing the natural stress response cycle. Stress is a biological signal that prepares our body for action, sharpening focus and boosting performance. By accepting and harnessing it, we can turn stress into a driving force that enhances resilience and motivation. However, it's equally important to fulfill the stress response cycle by our acceptance of stress. This ensures that we allow our bodies to return to balance, promoting overall well-being and long-term success.

## Product application
The philosophy of accepting stress has been applied in a local campaign for mental health. The "stresstoeter" is a symbol of overstressing, reminding us of the image we do not want to become. The "stresstoeter" has been incorporated in the physical world in the form of stickers which can be found on vehicles and in public spaces, as well as in digital images.
