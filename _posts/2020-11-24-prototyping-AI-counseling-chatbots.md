## Prototyping AI Chatbots
Seeking support and guidance online as seamless and natural as chatting with a friend. This vision comes to life through the innovative prototyping of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots designed to evoke genuine user willingness to converse. By employing the Research Through Design method, we meticulously develop and refine these chatbots to ensure they not only understand but also resonate with users on a personal level. Through iterative design and real-world testing, our chatbots learn to adapt their responses to individual needs and emotions, creating a supportive and engaging conversational experience that fosters trust and openness.

## Research Through Design
As we refine these AI-driven chatbots, the Research Through Design approach allows us to deeply investigate how users interact with and respond to different conversational strategies. Each prototype provides valuable insights into user behavior and preferences, enabling us to enhance the chatbot's empathetic responses and conversational flow. This iterative process ensures that the final product is not just a tool, but a companion capable of making online counseling more accessible and effective. With our cutting-edge prototypes, users are more likely to feel comfortable and motivated to engage in meaningful conversations, transforming the landscape of digital mental health support.
